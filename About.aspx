 <h2>About Me</h2>
 <p>My name is Scott Henkel and I’m a graduate student currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Systems and Technology, with a passion for bridging the gap between complex systems and practical business solutions. </p>
    <p>I currently work at Citigroup as a Senior Engineer Specialist, specializing in Mainframe MQ on the z/OS platform. With a strong foundation in enterprise-level infrastructure and messaging systems, I thrive in high-availability environments that support critical financial applications.</p>
